            <h2>University (2014 - 2018)</h2>
            <p>I studied Aerospace Engineering in The University of Sheffield. During this time I had many great experiences and I enjoyed my first stint of living in Yorkshire. Some of the modules I studied gave me experiences and knowledge with technologies like MATLAB and Python.
