            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Leon Panayi, and my journey has taken me from a Master's in Aerospace Engineering to becoming a Physics Teacher and eventually transitioning into the dynamic world of Software Development and Systems Engineering. I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences, combining technical expertise with a passion for creating engaging and innovative digital solutions. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I thrive on turning concepts into reality and continuously exploring the latest technologies.</p>
